blackBoxProject Instructions
======
These instructions are meant to explain how to use the **blackboxProject** without going into detail about how everything works. If you're looking to understand how something works or think you could make it work better, e-mail me, ndiamant@hmc.edu! I'm open to explaining and suggestions.

##Beginning##
Begin by cloning the repository, ```$ git clone https://github.com/ndiamant/blackboxProject.git```. Next, 
make sure to install all of the dependencies. 
* [plyj](https://github.com/musiKk/plyj) 
* matplotlib 
* mpl_toolkits 
* numpy 
* seaborn 
* pylab 
Plyj has a setup.py file, so can be installed by running ```$ python setup.py install```. 
The rest can be installed with ```$ pip install matplotlib numpy seaborn pylab```. 
Plyj only works in Python 2.

## Structure
The most fundamental of the programs is payloadReader.py
