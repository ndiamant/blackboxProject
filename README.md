# blackboxProject
Home for work on the BlueJ black box project at Harvey Mudd college. Currently has two files:

readbytes.py - used to read a payload file using an index file

testParse2.py - uses plyj parser to parse java files from readbytes.py

I will rename these files at some point. Users should not upload database files.
