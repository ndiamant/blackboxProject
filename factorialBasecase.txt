%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Good base case:
	1. contains 1 if statement, possibly 1 else statement
	2. if statement should be equal to:
		variable==1
		variable==0
		variable<1
		variable<=1
		variable<2
		variable!>1
		variable!>2
	note: extract variable name from function declaration
		after first if statement parse out white space
		check for equality to one of the above statements
		no hint neccessary


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Redundant basecase:
	has two or more ifs or any number of elifs
	
	potential hint for student: can you combine second if OR elif into basecase or recursive step


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Incorrect basecase:
	criteria 1 for good base case holds, but criteria 2 does not
		
	potential hint for student: think about basecase


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
No base case, but recursive step
	has function call to factorial function
	code will recurse forever
	
	potential hint for students: basecase
		
		
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Basecase not reachable:
	argument of recursive call not updated, so base case is never reached
	- looks like state 1 for basecase
	- get argument, check for it in body, make sure variabe is not decremented elsewhere
	
	potential hint for students: think about arguement of call to factorial 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Looping rather than recursion:
	look for for or while loops
	
	potential hint for students: use recursion
		
		
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Not yet implemented:
	no conditionals, recursive step or for/while loop
	potential hint for students: use recursion
 


Thoughts:
	Look for return statement in base case
	What is easier/quicker to find using ASTs vs looping through code?
