%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Good base case:
	1. contains 1 if statement, possibly 1 else statement
	2. if statement should be equal to:
		variable==1
		variable==0
		variable<1
		variable<=1
		variable<2
		variable!>1
		variable!>2
	note: extract variable name from function declaration
		after first if statement parse out white space
		check for equality to one of the above statements
		no hint neccessary


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Redundant basecase
	has two or more ifs or any number of elifs
		hint: can you combine second if OR elif into basecase or recursive step


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Incorrect basecase
	criteria 1 for good base case holds, but criteria 2 does not
		hint: think about basecase


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
No base case
	4A: no conditionals but recursive step == looping forever
		hint: basecase
	4B: no conditionals but for/while loop == not using recursion
		hint: recursion
	4C: no conditionals, recursive step or for/while loop == not yet implemented

*basecase not reachable
	- looks like state 1 for basecase
	- get argument, check for it in body, make sure variabe is not decremented elsewhere



Thoughts:
	Look for return statement in base case
	What is easier/quicker to find using ASTs vs looping through code?
